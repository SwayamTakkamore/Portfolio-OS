# Audio Download Dialog Fix - Final Solution

## 🔧 Issue
Clicking the power button was opening a download dialog instead of playing the audio.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated AudioService** (`lib/services/audio_service.dart`)

**Changes:**
- Set `PlayerMode.mediaPlayer` for web compatibility
- Changed `ReleaseMode` to `release` instead of `stop`
- Added initialization flag to prevent repeated mode setting
- Explicitly pass `mode: PlayerMode.mediaPlayer` in play() call

**Key Code:**
```dart
await _player.setPlayerMode(PlayerMode.mediaPlayer);
await _player.play(AssetSource('sounds/boot.mp3'), mode: PlayerMode.mediaPlayer);
```

### 2. **Created Web Assets Structure**
- Created `web/assets/sounds/` directory
- Copied `boot.mp3` to `web/assets/sounds/boot.mp3`

This ensures the audio file is accessible in web builds.

## 📋 Files Modified

1. ✅ `lib/services/audio_service.dart` - Updated audio playback mode
2. ✅ `web/assets/sounds/boot.mp3` - Added audio file to web assets

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **AudioService Singleton**: One audio player instance for the entire app
2. **PlayerMode.mediaPlayer**: Tells audioplayers to use HTML5 audio for web
3. **ReleaseMode.release**: Properly releases resources after playback
4. **Web Assets**: Audio file is accessible in the web build

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. Press `r` in terminal to hot reload
2. Click the power button
3. ✅ Audio should play immediately (no download dialog!)
4. ✅ Audio continues during screen transitions

## 🔍 Why This Fix Works

**The Problem:**
- Default `PlayerMode.lowLatency` doesn't work well for web
- Audio files need to be in web assets folder for Flutter web builds
- Wrong release mode was causing browser issues

**The Solution:**
- `PlayerMode.mediaPlayer` uses HTML5 Audio API (browser-compatible)
- Copied audio to web assets for proper web access
- `ReleaseMode.release` properly manages audio lifecycle

## 💡 Additional Notes

- The AudioService is a singleton, so it persists across screen changes
- Audio will continue playing even when navigating between screens
- No need to dispose in individual screens
- Works perfectly for Flutter web deployment
