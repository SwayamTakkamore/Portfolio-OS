# Audio Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Download Dialog Issue**
**Problem**: Clicking the power button opened a download dialog for the music file instead of playing it.

**Solution**: Created a singleton `AudioService` class that manages audio playback globally. This ensures the audio player persists across screen transitions.

**Changes**:
- Created `lib/services/audio_service.dart`
- Replaced direct `AudioPlayer` usage with `AudioService` singleton
- Used `AssetSource` for proper web audio handling

### 2. **Audio Interruption Issue**
**Problem**: Music was getting interrupted when switching from StartScreen to BootScreen.

**Solution**: The `AudioService` singleton persists across screen changes, so the audio continues playing even when the StartScreen is disposed.

**Changes**:
- Audio player is no longer disposed when StartScreen is disposed
- Singleton pattern ensures the same audio player instance is used throughout the app
- Added 150ms delay before navigation to ensure audio starts properly

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/services/audio_service.dart` (NEW)
```dart
class AudioService {
  static final AudioService _instance = AudioService._internal();
  factory AudioService() => _instance;
  
  final AudioPlayer _player = AudioPlayer();
  
  Future<void> playBootSound() async {
    await _player.setVolume(0.7);
    await _player.setReleaseMode(ReleaseMode.stop);
    await _player.play(AssetSource('sounds/boot.mp3'));
  }
}
```

### 2. `lib/screens/start_screen.dart` (UPDATED)
**Before**:
- Created new `AudioPlayer` instance in StartScreen
- Disposed audio player when screen was disposed
- Audio stopped when navigating away

**After**:
- Uses `AudioService()` singleton
- Audio player persists across navigation
- No disposal of audio service in StartScreen

## How It Works Now

1. User clicks power button
2. `AudioService().playBootSound()` is called
3. Audio starts playing through the singleton player
4. After 150ms delay, navigation to BootScreen occurs
5. StartScreen is disposed but AudioService persists
6. Boot sound continues playing during the boot sequence
7. Audio completes naturally without interruption

## Benefits

✅ No download dialog  
✅ Audio plays smoothly  
✅ Audio continues across screen transitions  
✅ Single audio player instance (better performance)  
✅ Easy to extend for future audio needs  

## Testing

Press `r` in the terminal to hot reload and test:
1. Click power button
2. Audio should play immediately (no download dialog)
3. Boot screen should appear while audio continues
4. Audio should play through to completion

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready for testing!
